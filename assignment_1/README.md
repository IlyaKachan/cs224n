# Assignment 1

Homework 1 (only) is a Jupyter Notebook. Once the environment is prepared
and activated, you should be able to get underway by typing:

```jupyter notebook exploring_word_vectors.ipynb```

To make sure we are using the right environment, go to the toolbar of
`exploring_word_vectors.ipynb`, click on `Kernel -> Change kernel`,
you should see and select `cs224n` in the drop-down menu.
