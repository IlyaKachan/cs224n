# Assignment 2

Before running the code please download the input data, which can be done
in one of the following ways:

- by running the bash script `get_datasets.sh`,
- by downloading the zip archive
([link 1](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/stanfordSentimentTreebank.zip),
[link 2](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/qL9EhxF1fXZz8Q)) with data and
unpacking it to `utils/datasets`. 

Make sure that the input folder stucture is the same as described below:
```
utils/
  datasets/
    stanfordSentimentTreebank/
      *.txt
```

The model params and states will be written to the root folder of this
assignment. The examples of such intermediate outputs can be found [here](
